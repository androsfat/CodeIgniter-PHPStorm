When creating a new project, clone this repository instead of the default on CodeIgniter.

Open the folder with PhpStorm.

Mark the only following files as Plain Text:

* 'system/core/Controller.php'   
* 'system/core/Model.php'   

The only files you actually need are:

* CI_phpStorm.php
* application/models/my_models.php
